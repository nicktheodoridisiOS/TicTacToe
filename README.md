The "TicTacToe" app offers the ultimate experience of the classic tic-tac-toe game, designed to allow you to play against artificial intelligence (AI) or challenge a friend on the same device. It's the game you love, enhanced with multiple customizations and settings to make it even more enjoyable.

### Available Modes
**Alternate Mode:** Test your wits against the app's AI opponent. Customize parameters such as the number of rounds and player names to tailor the game to your preferences.

**Double the Fun:** Invite a friend and create memories as you play tic-tac-toe together on the same device. Adjust settings to suit your preferences.
